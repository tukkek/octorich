# Octorich

Short description: this mod changes all enemy entities (except friendly NPCs) to reward ten times more experience, job points, leaves (money) and *Collect* outcomes.

Long version: this is an easy-mode mod made to enable single-session roguelite playthroughs and to reduce the amount of grinding required for any challenge runs.

## Rationale

Octopath Traveller is a JRPG with unparalelled replay-value and combat depth (comparable only to Saga and Bravely games) but these qualities are diametrically opposed to the incredible amount of artificial padding put into the campaign. [As one reviewer puts it](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/octopath-traveler-pc-review):

> I know that grinding up the level ladder is, to an extent, part and parcel of the JRPG's DNA but Octopath Traveller suffers from such a debilitating mid-to-late game slump that, even if I did have the time to put in another 30-40-odd hours to even stand a chance against that last boss, the foundations that hold up its core levelling system just simply don't run deep enough to support it for that length of time.
> 
>  I love Octopath Traveller's battle system. I really do. Just not enough to do what it's clearly asking of me.

NPCs were not altered simply because of how many of them there are, with no major benefit to altering their stats.

### A public apology to the Octopath community

I would like to apologize to absolutely everyone on Earth for not making this a x8 increase globally but just adding a 0 to hundreds of fields was simply easier. If anyone wants to help remake the mod with a JSON based pipeline let me know so we can get The Right Thingâ„¢ done.
